# Faial Optimal Usage Findings

This document outlines the best practices for using Faial to achieve accurate data-race freedom (DRF) analysis of CUDA kernels. Following these guidelines will help you to minimize false positives and get the most out of Faial's analysis capabilities.

## Understanding Faial's Analysis Approach

Faial is a static analysis tool that uses a compositional approach to prove data-race freedom in GPU kernels. It works by breaking down the kernel into smaller parts, analyzing the memory access patterns of each part, and then combining the results to reason about the entire kernel.

The key to getting accurate results from Faial is to provide it with a "well-formed" kernel snippet that it can understand. A well-formed snippet is a self-contained piece of code that represents a coherent unit of work.

## Preparing CUDA Kernels for Faial Analysis

To ensure that Faial can analyze your CUDA kernels correctly, you should follow these guidelines:

### 1. Provide Self-Contained Code

Faial performs a static analysis, which means it only knows about the code that you provide to it. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a self-contained snippet of code that includes all the necessary context for the analysis. This includes:

*   **All type definitions:** Any custom structs, enums, or typedefs used in the kernel must be included.
*   **All helper functions:** If the kernel calls any helper functions, their definitions must be included in the snippet.
*   **All constants and macros:** Any constants or macros used in the kernel must be defined.

### 2. Ensure Syntactic Correctness

The CUDA kernel code provided to Faial must be syntactically correct. Any syntax errors will cause the analysis to fail.

### 3. Analyze Coherent Units of Work

Faial's compositional analysis works best when it is applied to a coherent unit of work. This means that you should try to analyze a single kernel function or a small group of related functions at a time. Avoid analyzing a mish-mash of unrelated code snippets, as this is likely to confuse the analysis and lead to inaccurate results.

### 4. Clearly Define Dependencies

If you are analyzing a kernel that is broken down into multiple snippets, you must ensure that the dependencies between the snippets are clear. This means that any data that is shared between the snippets must be clearly defined.

## Using the `analyze_kernel` Tool

The `faial-mcp-server` provides the `analyze_kernel` tool for performing DRF analysis on CUDA kernels. To use this tool, you need to:

1.  **Run the `faial-mcp-server`:**
    ```bash
    faial-mcp-server --transport stdio
    ```
2.  **Invoke the `analyze_kernel` tool:** The exact method of invoking the `analyze_kernel` tool depends on how you are interacting with the MCP server (e.g., through a client application that communicates via stdio, SSE, or HTTP). You will need to provide the CUDA kernel code to be analyzed as input to the tool.

## Next Steps: Experimentation

The guidelines in this document are based on a theoretical understanding of Faial's analysis approach. To further refine these guidelines and gain a deeper understanding of Faial's behavior, the next step is to perform a series of experiments using the `analyze_kernel` tool.

By providing different CUDA kernel snippets as input and observing the analysis results, we can build a more comprehensive picture of Faial's strengths and weaknesses. This will allow us to develop a more robust set of best practices for using Faial effectively.
