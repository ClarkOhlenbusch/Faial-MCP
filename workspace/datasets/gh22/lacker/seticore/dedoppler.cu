  Kernel to runs one round of the Taylor tree algorithm, calculating the sums
  of paths of length `path_length`.
  Each thread does the calculations for one frequency.

  Apologies for the length of this comment, but the Taylor tree algorithm is
  fairly complicated for the number of lines of code it is, so it takes
  a while to explain. My hope is that this code will be comprehensible
  for people that have not seen the Taylor tree algorithm before.

  These paths are diagonal paths through the data, touching one element
  per row, using the nearest cell to a straight line. For example, if
  num_timesteps is 4, the paths for each path_offset look like:

  path_offset:   0        1         2          3
                 ..X..    ..X...    ..X....    ..X.....
                 ..X..    ..X...    ...X...    ...X....
                 ..X..    ...X..    ...X...    ....X...
                 ..X..    ...X..    ....X..    .....X..

  At a high level, you can recursively calculate all the sums of these
  paths in O(n log n) operations by running on the top half, then the
  bottom half, then adding them up appropriately.

  The key to understanding this code is to understand the format of
  the buffers, source_buffer and target_buffer.
  source_buffer and target_buffer store the sum along an
  approximately-linear path through the input data. The best way to
  think of them is as three-dimensional arrays, indexed like

  buffer[time_block][path_offset][start_frequency]

  path_offset is the difference between the frequency of the starting
  point of the path and the ending point of the path. It's in the range:
  [0, path_length)

  start_frequency is the index of the starting frequency, in the range:
  [0, num_freqs)

  time_block is a bit weirder. In our recursion, we don't need to keep
  sums for every possible start time. We can cut the number of start
  times in half, every step through the recursion. After n steps of
  recursion, we only need to keep a sum for every 2^n timesteps. So if
  start_time is the index of the starting time, in [0, num_timesteps),
  time_block obeys the relation

  time_block * path_length = start_time

  time_block thus is in the range:
  [0, num_timesteps / path_length)

  and each time block represents data for sums over path_length
  different start times.

  So each buffer holds (num_timesteps * num_freqs) elements.

  When we read input data, it's normally thought of as a two-dimensional
  array, indexed like

  input[time][frequency]

  Since we just pass the buffers around as one-dimensional arrays, this
  is essentially equivalent to thinking of it as a three-dimensional
  array in the above format, with path_offset always equal to zero.

  When we finish running the Taylor tree algorithm, time_block will
  always be zero. Thus we can think of the final output as a
  two-dimensional array as well, indexed like

  output[path_offset][start_frequency]

  It's really just for understanding the intervening steps that it's
  better to think of these buffers as being three-dimensional arrays.

  There's one more detail: drift blocks. So far we've explained the case
  where drift_block = 0, and we are calculating slopes between vertical
  and one horizontal-step-per-vertical step. You can think of this as
  the drift range [0, 1] when measured in units of
  horizontal-step-per-vertical-step. We can use a similar algorithm to
  calculate sums for all slopes in [drift_block, drift_block+1], if we just shift all
  accesses of the kth timestep by an extra drift_block * k.

  This kernel is designed to run one thread per frequency in the
  data. If it's trying to calculate the sum of a path that goes out of
  the range, it just won't write to that value. Any in-range path will
  get a value written to it. So you don't have to initialize the
  buffers, as long as you recognize that
  output[path_offset][start_frequency] is only valid when the last
  frequency of the path is within bounds, i.e.

  0 <= (num_timesteps - 1) * drift_block + path_offset + start_frequency < num_freqs

  This code is based on the original kernel by Franklin Antonio, available at
    https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/dedopplerperf/blob/main/CudaTaylor5demo.cu
